This will be something soon I promise

Heres a PoC of a Galaxy Sprint mod loader. It loads 2 additional JS files
alongside the game,

	target="_blank"
	><code>Loader.js</code></a

and
<a
	href="https://github.com/The0Show/lanemodder/blob/main/site/game/js/mod/poc.js"
	target="_blank"
	><code>poc.js</code></a
>. <br />Soon mods will be able to be loaded on the fly, rather than being
built-in like this.
<br />
<br />
You'll know that the mod works, since, well, it'll be really obvious.
